Download the compiled firmware or compile it yourself (if you need to make changes to the settings)

### Stable

## Flashing

This is easy. Just unplug your pi pico and replug it while you hold the little button on the board. It will mount a usb drive where you just need to paste the previously downloaded file. The pi pico will automatically reboot. That's it!
